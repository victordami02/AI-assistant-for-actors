Creating an llm model to act as an assistant to help actor understand movie script and give suggestions on how to act it out and rephrase the script to something the actor can say or make it better.
- developed an LLM application uing Google gemini pro and langchain where actors can ask questionsand suggestions about a script and how to act it out. deployed it using streamlit for the UI.
- In the dynamic world of acting, understanding and interpreting scripts effectively is paramount for bringing characters to life on screen or stage. The AI Assistant for Actors project aims to revolutionize this process by leveraging cutting-edge technology to provide actors with invaluable support and guidance.

At its core, this project involves the development of a Language Model (LLM) application tailored specifically for actors. Using advanced natural language processing techniques, the application assists actors in comprehending movie scripts, offers insightful suggestions on how to portray characters, and even provides assistance in rephrasing dialogue for optimal delivery.

Key Features:

Script Comprehension: The AI assistant is adept at parsing and comprehending complex movie scripts, breaking down dialogue, plot points, and character motivations with precision.

- Dialogue Enhancement: The application goes beyond mere comprehension, offering suggestions to enhance dialogue delivery, rephrase lines for clarity or impact, and tailor language to suit the actor's style.
- User-Friendly Interface: Developed using Google Gemini Pro and Langchain technologies, the AI assistant boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface built with Streamlit.
- Actors can easily interact with the application, asking questions, seeking suggestions, and refining their performances effortlessly.
### By harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the AI Assistant for Actors empowers performers to elevate their craft, delve deeper into character exploration, and deliver compelling performances that resonate with audiences.

This project represents a groundbreaking fusion of technology and artistry, bridging the gap between the world of acting and the realm of AI innovation. It stands as a testament to the endless possibilities when creativity intersects with cutting-edge technology.
